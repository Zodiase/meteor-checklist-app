# Checklist App

## Why?

The idea is, sometimes we need more than just a to-do list.

There are certain groups of tasks that need to be performed repeatedly (and likely in sequence) and the tasks in the groups don’t often change.

For example, a take-off checklist. (It’s not relavant to daily life but it’s a good example.)

Another example is a daily morning routine. One could put this in the calendar, but the difference of a checklist and a calendar schedule is a checklist can be started whenever needed. (Because I get out of the bed at different times every day.)

Let’s start simple and say the app should first support me doing my morning and evening routines.
